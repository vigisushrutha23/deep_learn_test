README

This package containes two simple programs. The purpose of tennis_train.cpp is train a neural network to recognize if there is a tennis racket in the image or not.
The tennis_recog.cpp is a code to load a preexisting network to recognize if there is a tennis racket in the image, then filename of which is provided by the user.
The executables can be found in the build folder. For recompilation, this you can navigate to the build folder, then "cmake .." and then "make". As this is a first 
attempt, the accuracy doesn't seem to be great during the testing process. Traning on muc higher number of images will be don in the next version.
